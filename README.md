# 🚀 AI Apps – *1 Hour a Day, Every Day*

This repo documents my journey of **building AI-powered apps by dedicating just 1 hour a day, every single day**.  

## ⏱ The Rule  
- Spend **1 focused hour daily** on building, experimenting, and shipping AI apps.  

## 🎯 Goal  
- Learn, explore, and showcase how **small consistent efforts** compound into real projects.  

## 🤖 Focus Areas  
- AI/ML-powered micro apps  
- Real-world problem-solving with LLMs  
- Quick prototypes in Python, React, and other stacks  

## 📅 Format  
- Each app/project will have its own folder  
- Includes:
  - Source code  
  - Short README  
  - Daily learnings or notes  
- Progress tracked daily  

## 💡 Philosophy  
This is not about perfection—it's about **iteration, consistency, and momentum**.  
Every day, one hour, one step closer.
